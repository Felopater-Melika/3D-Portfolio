        Hello! I&apos;m Felopater, a passionate full-stack developer
        specializing in React and Next.js. Although I have only one year of
        professional experience, my journey into the world of development began
        in high school, where I taught myself programming just to try a new
        thing and this is how I discovered my passion. My dedication to learning
        and my ability to pick up new concepts quickly have allowed me to
        complete various personal projects and two successful freelance jobs. As
        a self-taught developer, I take pride in being efficient, responsible,
        and always eager to enhance my skills. I genuinely believe that my love
        for development goes beyond just a careerâ€”it&apos;s also my hobby. Feel
        free to browse my portfolio to see the projects I&apos;ve worked on and
        get a glimpse of my capabilities. If you&apos;re interested in
        collaborating or have any questions, don&apos;t hesitate to reach out!
